<p>The purpose of having a corpus is that it allows for the development of tools that support authors and groups of people to better communicate, by enabling them to refer to the definition of a term whenever that term is used. This is particularly beneficial when a specific term can be interpreted in different ways (according to different definitions). </p>
<p>Tools that we envisage will query for terms from the corpus, and use that e.g. to create a custom <a href="#glossary" title="An alphabetically sorted list of terms with short explanations, usually aimed to help people understand texts around a certain (set of) topic(s) in some scope.">glossary</a> document, a terminology appendix in a paper you write, or as a resource from which you generate pop-up balloons in a website you create.</p>

<dd><p>A <strong>Risk</strong> is the effects that uncertainty can have on the intended realization of an <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> of a <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> (which we call the <a href="#owner" title="An Owner is a role that a party performs when it is exercizing its legal, rightful or natural title to control some entity.">risk owner</a>). Uncertainty is a lack of information, understanding or <a href="#knowledge" title="Knowledge is the (intangible) sum of what is known, the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something (WikiPedia).">knowledge</a> of events, their consequences or likelihoods, and this may affect the results that a party expects and intends to realize so as to fulfull its objectives.</p>
<p>While traditionally these effects are assumed to be negative (i.e. damaging, harmful) to this party, they may also be positive. For example, if you buy a ticket in a lottery, you (should) expect to lose money (the prize of the ticket). However, there is this uncertainty, this lack of information, the effect of it would be that this intended/expected result is deviated from, and you actually win a prize. If this risk is unacceptable (e.g. if you do not know how to manage large amounts of money), then that would call the risk to be <a href="#risk-management" title="Risk management is a process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific party for the purpose of managing the risks that it owns.">managed</a>.</p>
<p>Risk is about the <em>possible</em> effects that uncertainty may have on the intended/expected realization of an <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> of some <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a>. In this sense, at least in theory, this means that 'risk' is an objective notion because different parties may have the same ideas about what such effects on a given <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> could be. However, since an  <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> is owned by precisely one <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a>, and therefore only that party actually knows the actual meaning of that objective, in practice there is little point in drafting lists of such possible effects to make risk assessments easier.</p>
<p>An <em>acceptable risk</em> is a set of such effects that the <a href="#risk-owner">risk owner</a> has decided that it can, and is willing to deal with as they materialize. They need no further attention. Other risks would need attention and should be <a href="#risk-management" title="Risk management is a process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific party for the purpose of managing the risks that it owns.">managed</a>. Often, risks are assigned a <a href="#risk-level">risk level</a> to help risk owners prioritize the risks, allowing them to manage the most important ones before the less important ones.</p>
<p>The <a href="#owner" title="An Owner is a role that a party performs when it is exercizing its legal, rightful or natural title to control some entity.">owner</a> of a risk that is associated with an <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a> must be the <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> that <a href="#owner" title="An Owner is a role that a party performs when it is exercizing its legal, rightful or natural title to control some entity.">owns</a> that <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a>, and vice versa, because <a href="#ownership" title="Ownership is a relationship between two entities in which one of these entities (called the owner) is entitled to enjoy, dispose of, and control the other entity in an pretty much absolute (sovereign) fashion.">ownership</a> implies the <a href="#authority" title="An Authority is a party of which certain decisions, ideas, rules etc.">authority</a> to realize the <a href="#objective" title="Objectives drive parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the mission of that party.">objective</a>, which in turn implies the authority to manage the associated risks. Of course, as <a href="#owner" title="An Owner is a role that a party performs when it is exercizing its legal, rightful or natural title to control some entity.">owners</a> are <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a>, a risk owner may mandate actors to execute the actions that are necessary to manage a risk, but that does not relieve the party from its ownership (and facing possibly associated consequences). In fact, the objective of mandating risk management activities may come with risks which are often overlooked.</p>

<li><strong>decentralized or networked risk-management</strong>, which is a kind of risk management that assumes that the <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a> that runs it acknowledges the autonomy of other <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> to make their own (risk-related) decisions, and therefore starts and maintains relations with such parties that help them both to manage their individual, subjective risks.</li>

<dd><p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a term that has many different interpretations, and that we use to refer to <a href="#concept" title="A Concept tries to capture the idea behind a classification of entities[^1], allowing us to reason about everything in the class as if it were one thing.">concepts/ideas</a>, architectures, processes and technologies that aim to support (autonomous) <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> as they negotiate and execute electronic <a href="#transaction">transactions</a> with one another.</p>
<p>The dialogue about what Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) really is, that was started in the blog &quot;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity</a>&quot; by Christopher Allen in 2016, has not resulted in a consensus today. While some see the ten principles of SSI that Allen proposed as the definition of SSI, he formulated them as &quot;a departure point to provoke a discussion about what's truly important&quot;. And it is obvious that what is important differs per <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">party</a>.</p>
<p>The perspective that the eSSIF-Lab framework takes is that of supporting (autonomous) <a href="#party" title="A party is an entity that sets its objectives, maintains its knowledge, and uses that knowledge to pursue its objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.">parties</a> as they negotiate and execute electronic <a href="#transaction">(business) transactions</a> with one another.
